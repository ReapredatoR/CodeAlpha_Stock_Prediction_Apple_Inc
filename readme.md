## About Dataset:

The dataset captures the historical stock price information for Apple Inc., offering a comprehensive perspective on the company's financial performance over time. Each record corresponds to a specific date, beginning from December 12, 1980 to 2021. Here's a breakdown of the dataset columns:

- **Date:** The date of the stock price record, providing a chronological timeline for the dataset.

- **Open:** This column signifies the opening price, representing the initial price at which Apple Inc.'s stock started trading on a given day.

- **High:** Reflecting the highest stock price during a specific period, typically a trading day, the High column offers insights into peak price levels.

- **Low:** The Low column captures the lowest stock price observed during a defined period, indicating potential fluctuations in value.

- **Close:** Serving as a crucial indicator, the Close column denotes the closing price, representing the last recorded price at the end of a regular trading session.

- **Adj Close (Adjusted Close):** The Adj Close column adjusts the closing price to accommodate corporate actions, such as dividends, stock splits, or new stock offerings. This adjusted value provides a more accurate representation of the stock's true value.

- **Volume:** The Volume column measures the number of shares traded, offering insights into the level of interest and activity in Apple Inc.'s stock. This information is vital for assessing market dynamics.

The dataset spans several decades, offering a rich source of information for various analytical purposes. It's particularly useful for identifying trends, evaluating volatility, and building predictive models, such as the LSTM-based stock price prediction currently under exploration. Overall, this dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of Apple Inc.'s stock performance in the dynamic financial landscape.
